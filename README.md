# Proof of Ownership

This project is about a way to create a certification/validation system for owners of ERC721 tokens who wants to proove that they own but not using the
same wallet. Instead, they want to use a certificate in their daily usage wallet leaving the valuable asset in a safe cold wallet that doesn't
interact with anything for security purposes

The project comes with a ERC721 sample contract for testing purposes
